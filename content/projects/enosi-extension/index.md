# Agronet Automation Suite

**Vue.js Extension & AI Integration**

## Overview

A sophisticated browser extension and automation suite built to solve critical inefficiencies in the agricultural cooperative's ERP data entry platform.

### Problem
Employees were manually copying data between hundreds of land plots on a legacy web ERP. The process was error-prone, repetitive, and led to missed deadlines.

### Solution
I reverse-engineered the ERP's frontend and built a Vue.js overlay that injected automation controls directly into the UI.

## Key Features

- **Batch Data Injection**
  Enabled copying data from one plot to multiple others instantly, eliminating hours of repetitive clicks.
- **Background Validator**
  Automated manual checks in the background, showing a non-intrusive floating status window with required fixes.
- **AI Error Analysis**
  Integrated an LLM to parse error messages and automatically generate simple, copy-paste instructions for producers.
- **Year-over-Year Data Porting**
  Automated the migration of declaration data from previous years, saving ~5 minutes per application.
