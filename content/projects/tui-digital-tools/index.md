# TUI Digital Tools

**Hotel Map & Check-in Automation**

## Overview

A suite of digital tools developed to improve guest experience and operational efficiency at TUI Magic Life Plimmiri.

### Problem
Guests struggling with navigation due to outdated PDF maps, and reception facing long queues due to manual data entry requirements.

### Solution
Developed two complementary solutions:
