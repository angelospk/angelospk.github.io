# AthosCy

**Showcase Website for Church Products**

## Overview

AthosCy is a showcase website built for a company selling ecclesiastical products. The project demonstrates how to build a functional e-commerce-style catalog without the complexity of a traditional database.

## Key Features

- **Product Catalog** - Beautiful display of church products
- **Google Sheets Backend** - Uses Google Sheets as a database
- **Easy Updates** - Client can update products via familiar spreadsheet interface
- **Modern UX** - SvelteKit for fast, responsive pages

## Technical Innovation

### Google Sheets as Database

Instead of setting up a traditional database:
1. Product data lives in a Google Sheet
2. Google Sheets API provides read access
3. Changes appear on the site automatically

This approach is perfect for clients who:
- Are comfortable with spreadsheets
- Need to update products frequently
- Don't want to learn a CMS
