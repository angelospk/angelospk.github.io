# Skroutz Vanced

**Chrome Extension Enhancing the Skroutz Shopping Experience**

## Overview

Skroutz Vanced is a Chrome extension that enhances the shopping experience on Skroutz, Greece's most popular price comparison website. It provides users with price history data and insights that aren't available in the standard interface.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Historical Price Wheel** - Visual representation of price trends over time
- **Lowest Historical Price** - Shows the all-time lowest recorded price for each product
- **Price Trend Indicators** - Quick visual cues about price direction

## Why I Built This

As a regular Skroutz user, I wanted to make more informed purchasing decisions. The standard interface shows current prices, but doesn't reveal whether a product is at a historical low or if it's overpriced. This extension fills that gap.

## Technical Implementation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Platform** | Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) |
| **Language** | JavaScript |
| **Data Source** | Web scraping of price history |
| **Injection** | Content script modifying page DOM |
