# Diesi-stat

**Radio Station Music Statistics with Machine Learning**

## Overview

Diesi-stat is a data visualization and analytics project that analyzes 3 years of radio station play data. Using machine learning (KNN), it categorizes songs and provides insights into listening patterns.

This project was the precursor to the more comprehensive Diesi Analytics platform.

## Key Features

- **3 Years of Data** - Analysis of extensive radio play history
- **KNN Classification** - Machine learning for song categorization
- **Interactive Visualizations** - Charts and graphs for data exploration
- **Pattern Recognition** - Identifies trends in music preferences

## Technical Implementation

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Frontend | Vue.js |
| ML Model | K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) |
| Visualization | Interactive charts |
| Data | Radio station play logs |

### Machine Learning Approach

The KNN model:
- Groups similar songs based on features
- Predicts category for new songs
- Identifies outliers and anomalies

## Use Case

Understanding what music resonates with listeners helps radio stations:
- Optimize playlists
- Identify emerging trends
- Balance variety and familiarity

## Evolution

This project evolved into [Diesi Analytics](/projects/diesi-analytics/), which adds real-time features, a full backend, and more sophisticated ML predictions.
