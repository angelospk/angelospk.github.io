# AiMovie

**AI-Powered Movie and TV Show Recommendations**

## Overview

AiMovie is a personal movie recommendation app that uses AI (Gemini/OpenRouter) to suggest films and TV shows based on what you've already watched and enjoyed. Unlike generic recommendation engines, it maintains your viewing history to avoid suggesting the same content twice.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Recommendations** - Uses Gemini/OpenRouter LLMs for intelligent suggestions
- **Personal History** - Tracks what you've watched and liked
- **No Repeats** - Never suggests something you've already seen
- **Modern UI** - Dark theme with sleek, modern design

## How It Works

1. **Tell it what you've watched** - Add movies/shows to your history
2. **Rate your preferences** - Mark what you liked or didn't
3. **Get recommendations** - AI suggests similar content
4. **Build your list** - Save suggestions for later viewing

## Technical Implementation

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Frontend | Svelte |
| AI/LLM | Gemini API / OpenRouter |
| Design | Modern dark theme |

## Why I Built This

Finding what to watch next is surprisingly hard. Streaming platforms have massive catalogs, but their recommendations often miss the mark. This app uses conversational AI to understand *why* you liked something, leading to better suggestions.

## Use Case

Perfect for movie nights when you're stuck in "browse mode" endlessly scrolling through options. Ask the AI what to watch based on your mood, recent favorites, or specific criteria like "something like Interstellar but shorter."
