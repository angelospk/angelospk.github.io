# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Angelos**, a software developer from Northern Greece with a passion for building things that make a difference.

## The Short Version

I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineer (MEng, AUTH) who fell in love with web development somewhere along the way. These days, I spend most of my time writing **Go**, **Python**, and **TypeScript**, usually with **SvelteKit** or **Vue** on the frontend.

## What Drives Me

I get excited about projects where technology solves real problems. Whether it's helping an elderly person [learn to use a computer](/projects/pcbasics/), automating tedious tasks at a [local agricultural cooperative](/projects/), or building a [self-order system](/projects/order-local/) that runs on a Raspberry Pi—I love seeing my code make someone's day a little easier.

I'm a big believer in:
- **Keep it simple** - The best solution is often the simplest one
- **Local-first** - Build for reliability, not just connectivity
- **Automation** - If I'm doing something twice, I'll probably script it

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- ♟️ Playing chess (amateur but enthusiastic)
- 🎹 Learning piano (slowly but surely)
- 🎬 Subtitling films (yes, I built [a tool for that](/projects/subtitlekit/))
- 🏊 Swimming when the weather allows

## What I'm Looking For

I'm open to opportunities in **Full-Stack**, **Backend**, or **DevOps** roles. I work well in startups and smaller teams where I can wear multiple hats. Remote or hybrid works best for me, and I'm open to both Greek and international companies.

## Let's Connect

I'm always happy to chat about interesting projects, potential collaborations, or just to geek out about tech.
